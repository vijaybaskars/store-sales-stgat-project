# Phase 3 Quick Start Reference

## 🎯 NEW CHAT SESSION PROMPT

I'm continuing a Store Sales STGAT forecasting project.

PHASES 1-2 COMPLETED with exceptional results:
✅ Phase 1: 10 evaluation cases selected (quality scores 98.1-99.2)
✅ Phase 2: Traditional baselines complete - ARIMA best (0.4755 RMSLE)

CURRENT STATUS:
- Branch: phase3-neural-baselines
- Environment: store_sales_stgat (conda)
- Infrastructure: Production-ready, 100% tested
- Baseline established: ARIMA 0.4755 ± 0.2140 RMSLE

PHASE 3 OBJECTIVE:
Implement neural baseline models (LSTM, GRU) for the 10 evaluation cases to achieve 15-25% improvement over traditional baselines.

TARGET PERFORMANCE:
- Traditional best: 0.4755 RMSLE (ARIMA)
- Neural target: 0.38-0.40 RMSLE (15-25% improvement)
- Ultimate STGAT goal: <0.33 RMSLE (30%+ improvement)

MODELS TO IMPLEMENT:
1. Vanilla LSTM (basic sequential)
2. Bidirectional LSTM (forward + backward)
3. GRU (gated recurrent comparison)
4. LSTM with Features (enhanced with externals)

EVALUATION:
- Same 10 cases as Phase 2 for direct comparison
- Same train/test split (2017-07-01)
- Same RMSLE metric for consistency
- Statistical significance testing vs baselines

Please help me implement Phase 3: Neural Baseline Models with production-ready code, comprehensive evaluation, and academic-quality analysis comparing against the established traditional baselines.

## 🛠️ Technical Verification Before New Chat

conda activate store_sales_stgat
git branch  # Should show: * phase3-neural-baselines

python -c "
import sys; sys.path.insert(0, 'src')
from data import load_evaluation_cases
cases = load_evaluation_cases()
print(f'✅ {len(cases)} cases ready for neural baselines')
print(f'✅ Traditional baseline: 0.4755 RMSLE to beat')
"

## 📊 Key Performance Numbers
- Cases: 10 exceptional quality (98.1-99.2)
- Baseline: ARIMA 0.4755 ± 0.2140 RMSLE
- Target: 0.38-0.40 RMSLE (15-25% improvement)
- Best case: Store 53 PRODUCE (0.0910 RMSLE)
- Most challenging: Store 48 SCHOOL SUPPLIES (0.7026 RMSLE)
