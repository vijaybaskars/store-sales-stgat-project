# Phase 3 Context for New Chat Session

## Project Status: Outstanding Progress! üèÜ

### PHASE 1 COMPLETED ‚úÖ
- Quality: Exceptional results (98.1-99.2 quality scores)
- Cases: 10 high-quality evaluation cases selected
- Infrastructure: Production-ready EvaluationCaseManager
- Validation: 100% validation rate, data-driven methodology

### PHASE 2 COMPLETED ‚úÖ 
- Models: Traditional baselines implemented and evaluated
- Performance: ARIMA best model (0.4755 ¬± 0.2140 RMSLE)
- Coverage: All 10 cases successfully evaluated (100% completion)
- Quality: Academic publication standard analysis

### SELECTED EVALUATION CASES
1. Store 49 - PET SUPPLIES (Quality: 98.3, Best: 0.3233 RMSLE)
2. Store 8 - PET SUPPLIES (Quality: 98.1, Best: 0.3538 RMSLE)  
3. Store 44 - SCHOOL AND OFFICE SUPPLIES (Quality: 99.2, Best: 0.5009 RMSLE)
4. Store 45 - SCHOOL AND OFFICE SUPPLIES (Quality: 99.0, Best: 0.3234 RMSLE)
5. Store 39 - MEATS (Quality: 98.6, Best: 0.2017 RMSLE)
6. Store 53 - PRODUCE (Quality: 98.5, Best: 0.0910 RMSLE)
7. Store 26 - FROZEN FOODS (Quality: 98.9, Best: 0.4808 RMSLE)
8. Store 46 - SCHOOL AND OFFICE SUPPLIES (Quality: 98.8, Best: 0.4328 RMSLE)
9. Store 47 - SCHOOL AND OFFICE SUPPLIES (Quality: 98.8, Best: 0.6285 RMSLE)
10. Store 48 - SCHOOL AND OFFICE SUPPLIES (Quality: 98.6, Best: 0.7026 RMSLE)

### PHASE 2 BASELINE PERFORMANCE
Traditional Model Rankings:
1. ARIMA: 0.4755 ¬± 0.2140 RMSLE ‚≠ê BASELINE TO BEAT
2. Moving Average 7: 0.5046 ¬± 0.2020 RMSLE
3. Moving Average 14: 0.5090 ¬± 0.1920 RMSLE  
4. Seasonal Naive: 0.5212 ¬± 0.2223 RMSLE
5. Exponential Smoothing: 0.5274 ¬± 0.2138 RMSLE
6. Linear Trend: 1.1739 ¬± 0.5949 RMSLE

### PHASE 3 OBJECTIVES
- PRIMARY GOAL: Implement neural baseline models (LSTM, GRU)
- TARGET: 15-25% improvement over traditional baselines
- NEURAL TARGET: 0.38-0.40 RMSLE (vs 0.4755 traditional best)
- ULTIMATE STGAT GOAL: <0.33 RMSLE (30%+ improvement)

### TECHNICAL INFRASTRUCTURE
- Branch: phase3-neural-baselines
- Environment: store_sales_stgat (conda)
- Data Loading: get_case_train_test_data(sales_data, store_nbr, family)
- Case Management: EvaluationCaseManager (production-ready)
- Split: 2017-07-01 (consistent with Phase 2)
