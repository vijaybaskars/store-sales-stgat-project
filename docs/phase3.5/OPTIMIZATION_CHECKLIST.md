# Phase 3.5: Optimization Checklist

## 🎯 HIGH-IMPACT IMPROVEMENTS (Priority Order)

### 1. Data Preprocessing (IMPLEMENT FIRST)
- [ ] Replace MinMaxScaler with StandardScaler
- [ ] Add log1p transformation for sales data  
- [ ] Implement cyclical encoding (sin/cos) for temporal features
- [ ] Create enhanced lag features (1, 7, 14, 30 days)
- [ ] Add rolling statistics (mean, std, min, max for 7/14/30 windows)
- [ ] Increase sequence length from 20 to 45-60

### 2. Architecture Improvements (IMPLEMENT SECOND)  
- [ ] Increase hidden_size from 32 to 128-256
- [ ] Increase num_layers from 1 to 2-3
- [ ] Increase dropout from 0.1 to 0.3
- [ ] Increase training epochs from 30 to 100-200

### 3. Training Optimization (IMPLEMENT THIRD)
- [ ] Add learning rate scheduling (CosineAnnealingLR)
- [ ] Implement gradient clipping (max_norm=1.0)
- [ ] Increase early stopping patience from 10 to 20
- [ ] Add multiple random seed training

### 4. Hyperparameter Optimization (AUTOMATE)
- [ ] Install and setup Optuna
- [ ] Define optimization search space
- [ ] Run systematic optimization (50-100 trials)
- [ ] Select best configurations

## 🎯 SUCCESS VALIDATION
- [ ] Neural RMSLE < 0.43 (minimum success)
- [ ] Neural RMSLE < 0.38 (target success)  
- [ ] Statistical significance p < 0.05
- [ ] 7+ cases beat traditional baseline

## ⏱️ EXPECTED TIMELINE
- Setup & preprocessing: 1-2 hours
- Optimization run: 2-3 hours  
- Analysis & validation: 1 hour
- **Total: 4-6 hours**
