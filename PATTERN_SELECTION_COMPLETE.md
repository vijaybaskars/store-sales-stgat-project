## 🔬 **Research Methodology**

### **Research Question**
*"Does pattern-aware model selection improve time series forecasting performance compared to uniform model application?"*

### **Hypothesis**
Time series with different volatility characteristics require different modeling approaches:
- **REGULAR patterns** (CV < 1.5) → Neural models (LSTM variants)
- **VOLATILE patterns** (CV ≥ 1.5) → Traditional models (ARIMA)

### **Validation Approach**
1. **Pattern Classification**: Coefficient of Variation analysis
2. **Adaptive Routing**: Intelligent model selection  
3. **Comparative Evaluation**: vs Phase 2 & 3 baselines
4. **Statistical Testing**: Performance improvement quantification

## 🚀 **Usage Instructions**

### **Quick Test**
```bash
python test_pattern_selection.py
```

### **Academic Research Execution**
```bash
# Open Jupyter notebook
jupyter notebook notebooks/04_pattern_based_selection.ipynb

# Or use your preferred notebook environment
```

### **Python Import Usage**
```python
from models.pattern_selection import PatternBasedSelector
from data.evaluation_cases import EvaluationCaseManager

# Initialize
case_manager = EvaluationCaseManager()
selector = PatternBasedSelector(case_manager, pattern_threshold=1.5)

# Run evaluation
evaluation_cases = load_evaluation_cases()
results = selector.evaluate_all_cases(evaluation_cases)
```

## 📊 **Expected Academic Outcomes**

### **Research Contributions**
- **Methodological**: Simple, explainable pattern classification
- **Empirical**: Quantified improvement over uniform approaches  
- **Practical**: Production-ready adaptive selection system

### **Performance Targets**
- Eliminate catastrophic failures (RMSLE > 1.0)
- Beat traditional baseline on 60%+ of cases
- Average RMSLE improvement vs neural baseline
- Statistical significance validation

### **STGAT Foundation**
- Pattern insights for graph construction
- Node attributes based on volatility characteristics  
- Edge weights incorporating pattern similarities
- Multi-head attention specialization strategies

## 🎯 **Next Steps**

1. **Execute the notebook** to generate research results
2. **Analyze performance** against Phase 2/3 baselines  
3. **Document findings** for academic presentation
4. **Use pattern insights** to design STGAT architecture in Phase 5
