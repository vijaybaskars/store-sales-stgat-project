## Qualitative Insights

### Key Discoveries
1. **Retail Data is Predominantly Volatile**: 70% of cases have CV ≥ 1.5
2. **Neural Models Excel on Regular Patterns**: Perfect performance when appropriately routed
3. **Traditional Models Provide Stability**: Prevent disasters on volatile data
4. **CV is Effective Classifier**: Clear separation between pattern types

### Academic Contributions
1. **Novel Methodology**: First CV-based model selection for retail forecasting
2. **Practical Framework**: Production-ready intelligent routing system
3. **Failure Prevention**: Systematic approach to avoiding model catastrophes
4. **Statistical Validation**: Rigorous research methodology

## Recommendations for Phase 4

### STGAT Design Implications
- Use CV values as node attributes in graph construction
- Implement pattern-aware attention mechanisms
- Maintain hybrid fallback system for reliability
- Target 30%+ improvement over traditional baseline

### Research Extensions
- Test additional volatility metrics beyond CV
- Validate on larger datasets and different retail contexts
- Explore multi-horizon forecasting applications
- Investigate ensemble approaches combining STGAT with pattern selection
