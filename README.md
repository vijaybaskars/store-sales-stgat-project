# STGAT Store Sales Forecasting Project  

**Spatial-Temporal Graph Attention Network for retail sales forecasting using Corporación Favorita dataset**

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project develops a Spatial-Temporal Graph Attention Network (STGAT) that outperforms traditional ARIMA and LSTM models for retail sales forecasting using real Corporación Favorita data from Ecuador.

### Success Criteria
- STGAT RMSLE < Traditional methods (target improvement: 25%+)
- Real data validation throughout
- Academic-quality reproducible results
- Simple GCP demo for presentation
